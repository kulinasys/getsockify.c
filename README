This is websockify in C with a webserver on the same port with
encryption.

Much of code is picked from noVNC and tiny.c . So major credit is to
them. There is a python vesion with same features in noVNC. So it is
more or less same features in pure C. Ofcoure you need Xvnc and noVNC
for it to work as a web VNC server.
